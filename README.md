# Android Chat App

I created a small chat app using Firebase and Kotlin.

The app is simple: You log in with a Google account, then all app users are displayed in a list. Below that is a big button that says "Sign Out", which you can use to log out. If you click on a user, a chat appears. You can send a message to this person. As soon as you press send, the text field empties and the message should be displayed in the MessageLog.

The list of users in this project is just a list of fake users that I created and there is no Google account behind them. The reason for this is that the query of the database does not work. The chat history with the individual users is also not shown, because the database cannot be read. Also the sign-out function does not work properly. You are logged out, but at the same time you are logged in again.

All in all, the project was unfortunately a big fail. Nevertheless, I learned a lot of new things and gained new experiences. I also know now that I have to change my approach next time.
